# Telstra IoT prototype


This IoT application reports current
temperature and responds to the status requests and simulates the on/off command.<br>
This prototype utilises the AWS IoT cloud based platform to ingest the data.<br>
A client application subscribes and display the data.<br> see:(http://www.orgsensor.com)

## Components

- Hardware: ESP8266 NodeMCU or any device with credentials
- Amazon AWS account
- Amazon's aws management tool (see https://aws.amazon.com/cli)
- Amazon dashboard


## Architecture

The data flow is as follows:

- A device uses I2C temperature sensor and sends data to the AWS IoT periodically
- An AWS IoT rule intercepts temperature data and stores it into the DynamoDB table
- A device gets synchronised with its AWS IoT shadow
- A frontend is running on AWS S3, talking to the device shadow to get the device state.


## Design and Implementation Process 

The application was designed to be platform agnostic and deployable in any modern architecture via scripts.
